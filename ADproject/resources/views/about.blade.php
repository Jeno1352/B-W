        <p>Assalamualaikum. we are student of University technology Malaysia . we are making a website which is call Beefit.Users can use the application as an opportunity to monetize their exercises by simply signing up. The application provides a simple and straightforward way for other users to choose exercises in the application.The application will provide a reliable way for users to find their exercise based on their health information as well as availability. The user will be so satisfied with our application that they will then be encouraged to recommend it to their friends which will then generate more users which in turn will increase our reputation and most importantly continue funding towards maintenance and continuation of the application. Both the users and trainer will benefit from this application.The users can browse for exercises availability and view previous user experiences to aid in making the right decision as to which exercises are suitable for them.</p>
